# LIB rM Lines

This project is largely been made possible by all the findings made by the community. Projects
like [rMscene](https://github.com/ricklupton/rmscene).

But the goal is not just to read these files but to also have a comprehensive library to work with them, and to be able
to render them in real time.

This project will try to maintain compatibility as remarkable updates their file format.

### This library is:

- A `.rm` lines reader
- A real time renderer
- ~~A `.rm` lines writer~~ *not yet*

## Dependencies

- cmake - for building
- gcc - for building
- [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) - for building the wasm variant
- python3 - for building and running

If you have nix, run `nix develop` to get all of the above.

## Building

The project contains a cmake file with everything preconfigured.

### **To build the shared library file for your operating system**

```bash
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --target rm_lines
```

On Windows ARM64 (Visual Studio generator), configure the ARM64 target explicitly:

```powershell
cmake -B build -S . -A ARM64
cmake --build build --config Release --target rm_lines
```

The release workflow also builds a Windows ARM64 wheel using a native Windows ARM runner.

### **To build the library for wasm / web**

> Make sure you have [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) installed and configured

```bash
emcmake cmake -B build-web -S .
cmake --build build-web --target rm_lines_wasm
```

You can then run the small web demo, first host the root folder

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/)

### You can also build the test executable

```bash
cmake --build build --target test
```

## Testing

*If you build the test executable just run it directly.*

If you build the shared library file following the above steps you could now run one of the python tests in the `tests`
folder.

Make sure that they are ran from inside the tests folder! You can install any missing packages, if you run into any
other issue open it as an issue here.

## Shoutouts

This project wouldn't have been possible without [rMscene](https://github.com/ricklupton/rmscene) and the open sourced
project by reMarkable themselves [quill](https://github.com/CrimsonAS/quill) also a big shoutout to the Moss supporters
too!

Some of the test files included are by my fellow testers! Shout out to them too!

## Usage & Releases

You can find versionned releases of the shared library on this repo.

The shared library exposes a few basic functions to use. *(docs coming soon)*

You can also use wrappers:

- Python ([pyLIBrM_Lines](https://github.com/RedTTGMoss/pylibrm_lines))
